# asm-dom-boilerplate

A simple boilerplate to start using [asm-dom](https://github.com/mbasso/asm-dom) without configuration.
This includes:

- `asm-dom`
- `CPX support: JSX like syntax in C++`
- `parcel-bundler`
- `autoprefixer`

The boilerplate automatically compiles C++ code to WebAssembly and asm.js, the client will dinamically require the first if supported, the second otherwise.

## Prerequisites

- [node](https://nodejs.org)
- [npm](http://npmjs.com/)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [emcc](http://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/)

Please make sure to have `emcc` set as an environment variable and the lastest version of `node` to make parcel work. So, to validate the installation, please run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
make -v
emcc -v
```

## Getting started

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbasso/asm-dom-boilerplate.git
cd asm-dom-boilerplate
npm install # or make install

# if you are using windows, you have to make a little change to the Makefile in the root of the project, just open it and follow the instructions at the top

npm start # or make start
```

Then open `http://localhost:1234` to see the example app. You can now edit `index.cpp` and rerun `npm start` to recompile and see the changes.

## Building for Production

```bash
# just run:
make
```

This will compile your C++ and copy your `index.html` to the `dist` folder which you can deploy.

## Makefile

By default the boilerplate preprocess the `.cpp` files in the `src` folder with [gccx](https://github.com/mbasso/gccx) and automatically includes them when compiling. If you want to include external dependencies or add some C flags, you can modify the `Makefile` in the root of the project.

## CSS

[Parcel uses PostCSS plugins to manage CSS assets](https://parceljs.org/transforms.html#postcss).
The boilerplate includes `autoprefixer` for vendor prefixing, you can find and modify the PostCSS setup in `.postcssrc`.
